# php-licenser
This PHP code helps developers prevent their code from Piracy by generating a License Key and validation through Client Server technology.

The client sends the License Key, Package name, Domain name to the server. <br><br>
The server validates the data provided by the client using SQL Queries and sends JSON Response back to the client.

<br>
<b>Note:</b> Use of cURL has been used for sending HTTP POST Requests. Please look into that your client should support cURL. Also the Server should allow Cross Origin Requests.<br><br>
Feel free to edit this code.<br>
<b>PS</b> I'm still a student so sorry for all the mistakes you see in the code. I'm learning to code properly.
